# CSEC380-Work
This repository is a portfolio for potential employers to access of all of the work I have completed for CSEC 380, Principles of Web Applicaiton Security. All of the assignments have been published AFTER their due date.

ALL of the code published in this repository is in an altered state. Portions of code and assignment details may be altered and/or deleted entirely to prevent from future cheating and/or misuse of the code. 

The majority of this class is CONCEPT BASED, so not all assignments may be code-heavy or primarily rely on code to produce the answers. As a result, only PARTS of each assignment could be posted in one of the subdirectories. If that is the case, an explanation of the file and its purpose will be provided in said sub-directory's README file.

Code written for exams will NOT be published in this repository.

I, the code author and contributor of this repository, am the sole owner of all code published here (unless otherwise stated and created). All code published here is for PORTFOLIO USE ONLY. I, the contributor, am not responsible for any misuse of published materials
